# LinkedIn Application - Backend

LinkedIn Clone application is a social media platform built using Spring Boot microservices to manage user profiles, posts, and connections. The platform incorporates robust Spring Security for secure authentication and authorization. It uses Neo4j for efficient management of user connections, allowing seamless exploration of first, second, and third-degree relationships. The application also leverages Kafka for real-time notifications and inter-service communication.

## Key FeaturesüöÄ

6.**Post Management**
- Post Service enables users to create posts, like/dislike posts, and view user posts, enhancing engagement and interaction.

7.**Media Uploading**
- Uploader Service facilitates media file uploads using Cloudinary for secure and efficient media management.

8.**Service Discovery with Eureka**
- Implemented Eureka in the Discovery Server to manage service registration and discovery, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

9.**Dockerized Architecture**
- Containerized the entire microservices architecture using Docker, ensuring ease of deployment, scalability, and efficient resource management.
